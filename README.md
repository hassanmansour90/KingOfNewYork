# KingOfNewYork

This project is to simulate "King of Newyork" game and to be able to play it on a PC/laptop with just choosing/typing on screen, instead of having the game as object material and utilise a lotp of space to put and organize its contents.  

This project will allow you to play the game on TERMINAL and get standard output.

To play the game, you can choose to run either part 1, part 1-3, or part 1-4 file (while we recommend running part 1-4 as it's the completed version and contains pattern designs)
